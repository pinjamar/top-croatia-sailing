                        experienced with working on different types of boats as well as working with groups, individuals
                        and honeymooners. My personal preference is catamaran and my second name is teamwork. I will do
                        my best to give suggestions of nightlife or isolated evenings on the best locations if asked
                        for. I am well acquainted with the locals to provide the best of both worlds.</p>

                        I will be your clear-headed, logical type of skipper. I have sailed overseas and in my homeland,
                        a hard-working, dedicated team member with years of experience down the line. True dedication,
                        as well as work ethics, is what made me grow as a skipper in this line of work. I spend most of
                        the year living on the island and can give you first-hand experience of local food and customs.
                        Together we'll be chasing those sunsets and crystal beaches, maybe we even discover something of
                        our own.</p>

                    "This trip was by far one of the best experiences ever! We got to see different islands every day,
                    and also had nice swim stops along the way. I made some life long friends on the boat, and created
                    some amazing memories! Romano was the best skipper, and he made sure everyone was safe and having
                    fun. He also made sure that we got a spot on any excursion that we wanted to do, and all of his
                    recommendations were so fun and perfect! I highly recommend this trip, along with Romano as a
                    skipper. He truly made the trip even better!"</p>

                    great memories of our week long trip, thanks to him!! Romano was super attentive as to organising
                    group dinners (Iko's Farm being our all time favourite!) and activities, always making sure we had
                    spots on the excursions! He was also really easy to communicate with, funny & a genuine guy! It was
                    one of the best weeks ever - full of laughter, swims, delicious Croatian food/wine and making
                    friends/connections from opposite parts of the world."</p>

                    on every island serving us with advice at every step that made our vacation truly unforgettable.</p>

                    you want to navigate each day, and if you stay overnight in a Marina or at a buoy in a small bay."
